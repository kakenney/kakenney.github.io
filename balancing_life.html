	<p>Balance...isn't that something we all strive for??</p>
	<p>This is probably the area of my life that is CONSTANTLY under construction. </p>
	<p>Some days I do a great job and everything is flowing into place and some days everything falls apart. I think they most important thing to remember, is to strive for the best you can do in that moment.</p>
	<p>We all have a lot going on. Everyone has many things that they want to do and probably even more things they have to do. I always try to have a good attitude going into any task that needs to be completed. That makes the most difference for me. Even if it is a task I don't really want to do, going in with a good attitude can change the whole task.</p>
	<p>I think another important thing to stay blanced, is to make sure you surround yourself with what you want. So, surround yourself with people who are supportive and help you grow as a person. If you don't have people in your life that help or support you while you accomplish your goals it is much harder to accomplish them.</p>
	<p>Last but certainly not least, make sure you are taking time to rest and recharge. I try my best to do this for myself, but sometimes I have to be reminded by the people around me, or my body, to do this. I think my driven personally keeps me going, but I do enjoy quite time in nature. </p>
	<p>Those are a few things that I do to help me stay balanced. What do you do for yourself to stay balanced?</p>
