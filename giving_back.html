  <p>Giving back… What does that mean? </p>
  <p>Well, I don’t know that there is one answer to that question. Giving back can mean so many things to different people. I think you also must know your capacity and abilities. </p>
  <p>For some, that can be having positive interactions with those to come in contact with every day. For some, that can be being a mentor to someone in need. For some, that can be volunteering your time. </p>
  <p>For some, that can be donating to a cause. </p>
  <p>I think the most important thing is being a good and kind person, because you never know what another is going through and the simplest things can have a huge impact on their lives.</p>
  <p> If you can find your “why” and spread that through your life you are bound to bring the same passion to others. Spread what you love.</p><br><br></div>

<p> Hurricanes Sled Hockey is a non profit orginization committed to seeing that everyone can play hockey.</p>    
<p>They have a youth and adult team, both full of amazing individuals. 
<p>My husband is one of the founding members. I have been helping in tha background since it started, since we have 2 young kids. Now that the kids have gotten a bit older I have been able to take a more active role with the team. I just started helping with coaching this season and it is one of the most rewarding things I have done. I get to work with athletes that are just starting out and some that might be in the olympics one day.
<p>It is so much more then a game...Hockey Changes Lives!</p>
